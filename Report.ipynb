    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    " \n",
    "#### - Real-World Application: SGD can be used in the workplace to assess an employee's performance and contribution to any business.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### - Strength: SGD updates model parameters often during training, which results in a detailed rate of improvement. It can avoid local minima better than normal Gradient Descent because of the randomization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Weakness: The rate of convergence is slow and dependent on the feature scaling. Regular changes cost a lot to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Applicability: A straightforward yet incredibly effective method for fitting linear models is stochastic gradient descent. It is especially helpful when there are a lot of samples and features, which in this case total 103 after one-hot encoding. This model would run swiftly and converge for the specified dataset size. As a result, this paradigm might work well for this issue.\n",

    "### **Gradient Boosting **\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Real-World Application: One method for creating machine-learned ranking search engines is gradient boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Strength: In an effort to rectify or enhance the model's final output, this algorithm creates or enhances the model in a way that complements the earlier produced sequence of models. Natural handling of heterogeneous (= mixed type) features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Weakness: Because it is more difficult to run parallelly, this paradigm has time-consuming drawbacks. Additionally, there are more parameters to tweak and they are slightly more prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Applicability: This method uses other, often Decision Tree-based, weaker algorithms, strengthens them through learning, and then combines the results to produce the optimal model. Numerous features in our dataset have non-linear relationships between them. Decision trees automatically screen variables or choose features. Additionally, the performance of trees is unaffected by non-linear correlations between parameters. Gradient boosting is one of the finest candidates for this dataset because decision trees are a good fit for it and can be used to create a number of them that keep getting better.\n",

    "#### - Real-World Application: There are numerous industrial uses for this. The Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), which is frequently employed to forecast death in injured patients, is one application in medical research. widely employed while creating deep learning neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Strength: For a small dataset with few features, this is easy, quick, and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Weakness: The generalizability of the model outside of the data on which it is fitted can be reduced by adding more characteristics to the model due to overfitting. Data outliers have a negative impact on the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Applicability: One of the simplest models for binary classification is this one (for our dataset, person earning less or equal to 50k or more than 50k). Additionally, it serves as a useful benchmark for assessing how other, more sophisticated algorithms perform. So, picking this one is essential.\n",

    "#### In simple terms, the Gradient Boosting algorithm can be compared to a young child who is always learning from their mistakes and experiences. A child that is learning anything new begins by taking baby steps and then keeps going after seeing positive results. When a mistake is made, it is improved by what was learned, and the entire process is added to the experiences. Families and educators help and monitor kids to ensure they continue on the correct track. The youngster receives advice, suggestions, or even punishment at every turn to help them develop into kind, sociable people. The child in this situation is a Decision Tree model, who is inexperienced and weak. Here, the family or the teachers serve as a loss function that monitors the behaviour or development of the weak model. A small bit of advise or a recommendation at every stage helps the model become more optimised and suited to the dataset as well as society. For the purposes of this discussion, it should be noted that gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems that generates a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, often decision trees. So, we first understand what decision tree is with the help of our data. Let's think of three persons, first one is a student, second and third are working professionals. We categorise them into two labels earning '<=50k' or '>50k' with features as work class (working or student) and their education level (having bachelor’s degree or not). First person being student, having no source of income, we put him under label earning less than '<=50k'. 2nd person who is in working class but don't have bachelor’s degree has no good job and earn less also labelled as '<=50k'. Now 3rd person, first falls into working class category and then fall into earning well with a bachelor's degree is designated as \">50k.\" Thus, this creates the decision tree, a structure resembling a tree, as seen below. Such trees are created \"sequentially,\" with each one learning from the faults of the preceding one. We refer to this as boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Any algorithm for supervised learning has a loss function, and we want it to be as small as possible. We can determine the values where the loss function is minimal by employing gradient descent and revising our predictions based on a learning rate. In essence, then, we are updating the predictions so that the sum of our residuals is close to 0 (or minimal) and the anticipated values are close enough to the actual values. The idea behind the gradient boosting approach is to repeatedly use residual pattern recognition to improve a model with weak predictions. When residual modelling reaches a point when there is no longer any discernible pattern in the residuals, residual modelling can be terminated (otherwise it might lead to overfitting). We are mathematically minimising our loss. We are minimising our loss function algorithmically such that the test loss reaches its minimum. To summarise, we first model data using straightforward models and then check the data for mistakes. These errors are data items that a straightforward model finds challenging to fit. Then, in order to correctly fit later models, we pay close attention to those challenging data. By assigning each predictor a certain amount of weight, we integrate all the predictors in the end.\n",
